h2. Rails translations

Simple tool for testing the integrity of your key structure:

Make sure you have the Ruby I18n gem installed. If you haven't already you can try: 

sudo gem install svenfuchs-i18n -s http://gems.github.com

Then, standing in the root directory of this repository, do:

ruby rails/test/structure.rb [your-locale]

Assuming that there is a file rails/locale/[your-locale].{rb,yml} you will get a summary of missing and bogus keys as well as extra pluralization keys in your locale data.
